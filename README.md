fern_macros (deprecated)
========================

Deprecated crate which used to accompany the `fern`.

Before version 0.2, fern used to act as an independent logging library - and thus included its own logging macros.

This crate is used to accompany fern version 0.1, and is heavily deprecated. The original code remains for backwards compatibility reasons, but upgrading `fern` to version 0.2+ will be a great improvement.
